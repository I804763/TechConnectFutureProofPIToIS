# Exercise 1 - SAP Process Integration walkthrough

In this exercise, you will

- take a virtual walkthrough of a SAP Process Integration system and look at an ICO (Integration Configuration Object) definition of an interface that exposes a simple SOAP-to-SOAP Integration.
- note that there is no hands-on for this exercise as there are logistical challenges in enabling each participant to access an onpremise system, hence a virtual walkthrough by looking at screenshots alone.

## Access a virtual machine (or a physical server) connected to the SAP Process Integration instance

## Connect to the Integration Directory
1. Switch back to the SAP Integration Suite landing page by pressing the SAP logo.
