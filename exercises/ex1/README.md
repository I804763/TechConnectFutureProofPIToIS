## Explore SAP Integration Suite tooling

Log in to SAP Integration Suite tenant using the credentials provided to you by the instructors. Now let´s explore the different capabilities and navigations of SAP Integration Suite tooling <br>

Home is the first screen that you will land upon logging in to SAP Integration Suite. Click on the three lines icon in the top left corner to expand the navigation menu items. <br>

The first section is the Recent Activities & Monitoring, which gives you a snapshot of what´s going on with the SAP Integration Suite tenant. It lists the artifacts that were worked upon and also the monitoring status of the deployed artifacts. You can navigate to them directly from here.

Then you will see the list of Capabilities that are activated in this tenant. SAP Integration Suite provides many different capabilities like Cloud Integration, API Management, Integration Advisor, Trading Partner Management, Open Connectors, Integration Assessment, and Migration Assessment, to address all your integration requirements.


Last section of the Home page is the Learning & Feedback, where links to documentation, tutorials, and also an option to request for addititional features. <br><br>






Now if you look at the different navigation sections on the left, after Home, you will see Discover, which is a repository of all standard pre-built content (integrations, APIs and type systems) shipped by SAP. Based on your specific integration need, you can explore, search and copy them to your Design workspace to kick-start your integration development. <br><br>






Design is your local workspace where you can design and configure integrations, APIs, message implementation guidelines, mapping guidelines, scripts and other integration artifacts. <br><br>






Test your APIs and analyse the response you get from them <br><br>






Use this section to Configure API Providers, Certificates and Key Value Mappings for your APIs <br><br>






In the Monitor section, you can check the deployment status, look at message processing logs, manage security materials, data stores, message queues and all that you need to monitor and operate your integrations across multiple runtimes. <br><br>






Inspect enables you to assess the overall resource situation of the tenant, like identifying hotspots, breakdown of resource consumed by each integration flow, resource usage trends. <br><br>






You can use Monetize to define rate plans for the API Products that you build and check the API usage pattern. The in-built billing engine also generates the bills for you, which can be accessed across multiple channels. <br><br>






If you have Tenant Admin role assigned, you will be able to access Settings. Here you can configure settings which are applicable for the entire tenant like managing runtime profiles, configuring transport management, setting up API Management, customization of MIGs & MAGs, etc. <br><br>
